It's easy to configure SSR on Windows or Mac by tutorial above.

## How to configure SSR on Linux

- Download [ssr script](https://github.com/the0demiurge/CharlesScripts/blob/master/charles/bin/ssr) and install using its tutorial. 
- If you meet some errors about some files lost, like ```ssr.pid``` or ```ssr.log```, just ```touch``` the file and reinstall.
- Download ```SwitchOmega``` in browsers' extensions store. Firefox can directly install the extension. But Chrome needs some tricks.
- Here's a [trick](https://github.com/Magicalsoso/SwitchOmega) for Chrome. Actually, our repository has a backup. :P
- Rename ```SwitchOmega``` install package to ```xxxxx.zip``` and ```unzip``` it. Open developer mode in Chrome and you are clever to install and configure ```SwitchOmega```.
